⚡ EV Energy Consumption Prediction
A complete end-to-end machine learning project that predicts the electric energy consumption (kWh) of an Electric Vehicle (EV) trip using real-world driving and environmental parameters.
Built with a multi-model ensemble of XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, combined through an optimized weighted average.
Includes a Streamlit web app frontend for interactive trip-wise prediction.

🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates:

Data preprocessing and robust feature engineering for EV trip data.
Hyperparameter tuning with Optuna for XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
Ensemble modeling for improved prediction accuracy (R² ≥ 0.95).
Interactive UI built with Streamlit for real-time energy consumption estimation.
🧠 Features
⚙️ Machine Learning Backend:
Auto-tunes XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost regressors.
Computes 13 engineered features (speed, kinetic energy, battery power, etc.).
Uses weighted ensemble for final energy prediction.
🎨 Frontend (Streamlit App):
Interactive sliders and dropdowns for trip parameters.
Real-time prediction and model comparison charts.
Visual, user-friendly dashboard with tooltips and metrics.
